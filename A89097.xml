            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F my wiſhes could prevaile againſt the neceſſity of the times, or if by hieroglyphicks I could expreſſe the ſenſe of that truſt, in which by a ſympathy with my Countrey, and requeſt of my friends I ſtand now engaged, I ſhould be moſt unwilling to ſalute this Scene with a Tragedy, or to preſent unto the continued, yet unwearied labours of this Honourable Aſſembly, any out-bred diſcontents, ſince too too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny are unfortunately hatched and nouriſhed within your owne cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; whilſt the Ship ſaild upon ſmooth waters, the Diſciples luld their Maſter aſleepe, but when the thunder broke forth, the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings flaſhed, the waves crowded on heapes, then their feares plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded an apology for their want of faith and manners to awaken him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> the times were when the Kingdome of <hi>Ireland</hi> ſaild upon ſmooth waters; <hi>Leinſter</hi> and <hi>Munſter</hi> never diſquieted in their eſtates: <hi>Connagh</hi> ſtretcht forth it ſelfe in the happy aſſurance of its legall ſettlement; <hi>Vlſter,</hi> though wounded and in Capite by alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of her tenures, yet was ſalved and recovered by the Royall promiſe for its reparation.</p>
            <p>Nationall grievances were ready for the ſickle (in which let mee never forget the great aſſiſtance and reſpect our Committee received from this Honourable Houſe) and by a favourable digreſſion excuſe our Kingdome from a ſuſpitious Lethargy that ſuch a horrid mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, as this preſent Rebellion, ſhould be conceived among us, and yet never felt to kick in the wombe, nor ſtruggle in the birth: Since that diſcontent in the Subject, which is the fore-runner of Rebellion, was ſo fully baniſhed, that the reſt of our life would be to leave off prayer, and fall to praiſe; to lay downe our requeſts, and take up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:156741:3"/>
But now <hi>(Maſter Speaker)</hi> the thunder roares from the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels Cannons, the lightning flaſhes from their fire-workes, the waves of innocent bloud crouds up in heapes, then pardon our juſt feares if they addreſſe themſelves to this Houſe in theſe words, <hi>ſi deſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris tu, perimus,</hi> onely in this I muſt contradict the application; you have wanted no vigilancie, nor we ſenſe thereof, nor faith therein.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> the rolation I ſhall trouble your patience withall, will be of ſuch particulars as are confined within the limits of the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> the County of <hi>London-derry,</hi> the County of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managh,</hi> and the County of <hi>Donegall,</hi> the greater part of the Province of <hi>Viſter;</hi> to all which my eyes have beene the witneſſes, or elſe bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanced with equall credit: for as for ſuch paſſages that are grounded upon here-ſaies, I eſteeme an unwarrantable diſcourſe for the gravity of this audience: beſides all wayes of intelligence from our friends have received ſuch obſtructions by our enemies, that from the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> untill the third of <hi>May,</hi> we never received one ſyllable from <hi>Dublin,</hi> in what condition thoſe parts ſtood, which I doubt not, though uncertaine to us in the ſame Kingdome, is but ſtale and common in this: and by the ſelf-ſame rule I conceive the ſtate in <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are as doubtfull of our condition in thoſe parts, and not able to know where our ſhooe pinches us, except they can ſay that it wrings the whole foote, which is too manifeſtly true.</p>
            <p>Though the poyſon of this Rebellion was diffuſed through the veines of the whole Kingdome, yet it broke the skin with its plague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tokens in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> and <hi>Fermanagh</hi> firſt.</p>
            <p>The ſuddenneſſe of our ſurpriſall, and the nature of it, was ſo unexpected, that the Inhabitants could ſcarcely beleeve themſelves priſoners, though in their chaines, and the Iriſh ſervant which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night was undreſſing his Maſter in duty, the next morning was ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Maſter and Miſtris with a too-officious tyranny.</p>
            <p>Here in the twinckling of an eye, the Corporations, Townes and Villages proclaimed their ſcituation a farre off by their fire and ſmoake; here you might ſee hundreds of men, women, children, of all conditions and eſtates, that had lived in moſt plentifull and ſecure habitations, expoſed to the rocke for ſhelter, to the Heavens for cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, ſo that many hundreds in a few dayes ſtarved upon the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines.</p>
            <p>Where was here any expectation of reliefe? the husband could not relieve the wife, nor both, or either of them their children: the Maſter could not provide for his family, neither was there any reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>procall duty or ſervice from theſe to be performed to the advantage of the other: one and the ſelfe-ſame face of miſery, was unequally, equally ſet upon all, one and the ſelfe-ſame black complection of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:156741:3"/>
ſtained every viſage; The Land-lords Paramount title over the Tenant, was with himſelfe out of doores, and they which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were, and now ſhould have beene moſt beneficiall to the diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, were moſt burthenſome to themſelves, and others, as being leſſe read, in this hard, and untutored Chapter, of perſonall and moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsary wants.</p>
            <p>Who can remember without griefe, the generall burthen of each expreſſion, <hi>Give us bread, or elſe we periſh?</hi> and their famiſhing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands onely ſatisfyed with a comfortleſſe Echo of the ſame words?</p>
            <p>But this nakedneſſe and famine, and their male and female iſſue (variety of diſeaſes) were adjudged overflow executioners, of the ſurviving <hi>Brittiſh.</hi> Then entred the ſword, deſtroying at the firſt, with the Scabbard on. The Rebels under a faire and colourable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a Convoy inviting the hidden and ſcattered Proteſtants in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a body, that ſo they might (as they moſt perfidiouſly did) make each ſurviving man, an Executor to the laſt murthered in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, and ſo the whole line one by one extinguiſhed, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Prieſt as Ordinary, adminiſtred for all.</p>
            <p>This the Sword acted in a Fox-skinne ſcabberd, and then flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in one of a Lyons skin, ſeeking whom it might devoure, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring all that it ſought after; for I can confidently affirme, that out of the County of <hi>Fermanagh</hi> one of the beſt planted Counties with <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I could never give an accompt of 20 men eſcaped, except, w<hi rend="sup">ch.</hi> is moſt improbable, they ſhould flye to <hi>Dublin;</hi> as for the chiefeſt (my owne eſtate meering upon the Marches of that County) ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inquired from priſoners, by name for ſuch and ſuch, they have informed me they were all maſſacred.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Blackwater</hi> in the County of <hi>Tyrone,</hi> a moſt fertile ſoyle, and inhabited with the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> had its ſtreames dyed in blood, there being at one time above 200. ſoules murthered upon the Bridge, and flung downe the River. I could inſtance alike in many places, but that we are to allow buryed miſerie too timely a reſurrection.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> in theſe two laſt inſtances, I have onely named the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> not but that I pleaſe my ſelfe better in concluding both <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Scotch,</hi> under the title of <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> but that there ſeemeth to be ſome reaſon; for in the Infancy of this Rebellion, the Rebels made open Proclamations upon paine of death that no <hi>Scotch man</hi> ſhould be ſtirred in body, goods, or Lands, and that they ſhould to this purpoſe write over the Lyntels of their doores, that they were <hi>Scotch men,</hi> and ſo deſtruction might paſſe over their families; nay, I read a Letter that was ſent by two of the Rebels titulary Collonels, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonell <hi>Nugent,</hi> and Colonell <hi>O Gallogher,</hi> a quarter of an houre be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my Colonell Sir <hi>Ralph Gore<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:156741:4"/>
               <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> and there ſlew out-right 180. of their men, without loſſe of one man on our ſide, (praiſed be God) which was directed <hi>to our Honourable Friends, the Gentlemen of the never conquered Scotch-Nation,</hi> it expreſt, that they were both of one extraction in former times, joynt-aſſiſtants, that their quarrell, if aright underſtood by them, as by the beſt of <hi>Scotland,</hi> they would be otherwiſe adviſed, then to joyne with us, and many other paſſages that I may ſeaſonably for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get here; I onely touch this, not as judging where there is ſmoake, there is ſome fire, but to obſerve their policy, which, though to ſome that were ſuddenly ſurprized, might afford ſecurity to retreate into ſome place of ſafety, yet it was ridiculouſly entertained, and as reſolutely ſcorned by the Scottiſh Nation.</p>
            <p>Hitherto (with your patience) is rough drawne the generall e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate, and condition of the <hi>Brittiſh,</hi> who were now betaking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to better reſolutions, in oppoſition to the enemies fury.</p>
            <p>I ſhall beginne with the County of <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> where thoſe that had eſcaped the fire and ſword of <hi>Rory Mac Guyre,</hi> the Arch-Rebell in that County, brother to the Lord of <hi>Eniskellen,</hi> drew themſelves into <hi>Eniskillen,</hi> a place fortifyed by nature, under the Command of Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> Colonell.

            <p>Collonell <hi>Nugent</hi> a moſt ſeditious inſtrument, that married the Lord of <hi>Eniskillens</hi> mother, drew about 600 men about <hi>Ballyſhannon</hi> Caſtle, a place of great ſtrength and importance, againſt whom my Collonell Sir <hi>Ralph Gore,</hi> and Captaine <hi>Maxwell</hi> a forward Gentleman drew out ſome 200 men and 60 horſe, who encountred them, routed them, kild upwards of 180 Rebels, tooke Collonell <hi>Nugents</hi> horſe who left it and his bootes ript off behinde him, beſides many that came downe the river by dozens and tennes which were killed by the foote, and not

Divers ſallies were made by Captaine <hi>Iohn Follyot</hi> a Gentleman deſerving much commendations for his courage and diſcretion, as alſo by his Lievetenant <hi>William Ancktill</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquire, a bold Comrade, ſometime killing 20. 30. in which Captaine <hi>Follyot</hi> received a ſore wound in his hand, being at the ſword entred and beſet with the Rebels.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight after their defeat at <hi>Ballyſhannon,</hi> the Rebels mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered new forces, and with aſſiſtance of Colonell <hi>Manus O Donnell,</hi> and Colonell <hi>Turlogh, Mac Caffrye O Donnell,</hi> they beſieged my Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels Caſtle, he being gone over the mountaines for Ammunition, the Rebels fired ſome out-houſes, but were beaten off with loſſe of twenty men, who attempted to burne the gate.</p>
            <p>In the Barony of <hi>Boylagh</hi> about two dayes after the <hi>Mac Swynes,</hi> and the <hi>O Boyles,</hi> were encountred about <hi>Kilbegge</hi> by Maſter <hi>Andrew Knox</hi> a Miniſter, who though very unequall in number to the Rebels held them up at puſh a pike, and killed about 80. of their men, and put the whole body to flight, and brought home a great prey. In which skirmiſh the beſt <hi>Mac Swyne</hi> was killed.</p>
            <p>Theſe, <hi>Maſter Speaker,</hi> are the Occurrences in thoſe three Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that were precedent unto any Commiſſion granted for raiſing of Regiments, and now I ſhall according to the rule I propounded unto my ſelfe, firſt relate the exploites of every Regiment apart, and then of ſuch ſervice as was done joyntly, and as I began with <hi>Fermanagh,</hi> in what was performed before any Commiſſion, ſo I ſhall endevour the ſame in theſe ſubſequent Occurrences.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tullagh</hi> and <hi>Liſgold</hi> Caſtles, being formerly ſurrendred upon promiſe of quarters, which was performed in this manner, they ſtript old and young, and bound them, expoſing them all night to the froſt and ſnow, and next day killed them, <hi>Moneigh</hi> Caſtle joyned to Sir <hi>William Cole,</hi> and marcht out into the fields to <hi>Lowtherſ-towne,</hi> where they had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, they were drinking upon their march towards <hi>Eniskilling,</hi> and ſurpriſed them unawares, and purſued them ſome foure miles with ſlaughter of above 200. men, tooke foure Colours, ſome Drums, two Captaines, one <hi>Mac Mahoun,</hi> another <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> with ſtore of Armes.</p>
            <p>After this he marcht out with 400. men, and having burnt the corne and the enemies garriſons, was met in his march homewards, by <hi>Mac Guire,</hi> with 800. men, with great violence charging his Vanne, and unexpectedly 400. more of the <hi>Mac Mahouns,</hi> charged him on the Reare, he put them all to flight, kild upwards of a 100 men, got 60. Muskets, and many Pikes, he hath taken all their boates upon <hi>Loug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearne,</hi> ſunke their <hi>Cotts,</hi> and both by Land and water made himſelfe a very good paſſage, though I conceive he is now in much diſtreſſe.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:156741:6"/>
This is what I can certainly averre, though we heard many other paſſages of much credit, but I am certaine he is not a ſleepe, when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny opportunity ſhall require.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now leave <hi>Fermanagh</hi> in this Diſcourſe, and remember it in my prayers, and paſſe to Sir <hi>William Stewarts</hi> Regiment and Sir <hi>Robert Stewarts,</hi> whom though I but now name, have given moſt brave teſtimonies of Commanders every way well qualified. After the unfortunate and unworthy loſſe of <hi>Strebane,</hi> theſe Regiments garriſon'd upon ſuch frontier places, as might ſecure the Barrony of <hi>Rapho,</hi> in which the ſafety of the City of <hi>London-dery</hi> was highly concerned, as alſo the Barrony of <hi>Eniſhoen,</hi> in which 2000. able fighting men of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> ready then (though we conceive better of them now) to have fallen upon our backs upon the leaſt invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any defeat unto us. Sir <hi>Ralph Gores</hi> Regiment being but 500. foot march'd into the Barronies of <hi>Boylagh</hi> and <hi>Bannagh</hi> and <hi>Tir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hugh,</hi> being Barronies that had bin wholly waſted by the Rebels, where for 13 weeks we had no ſuſtenance, but what we pul'd out of the Rebels mouths. Theſe two Regiments were for the moſt part mingled in ſervice, and having ſo great a ſcope as 36. long <hi>Iriſh</hi> myles to guard in the long winter nights, and every way paſſable for the enemies entrance, and the charge of ſo many ſoules there reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding and following their vocations, as in the time of peace, beſides the conflux of thouſand of plundered Families, I beleeve in a ſerious conſtruction it will deſerve the title of miraculous ſervice; for few nights, but the enemy attempted in ſeverall places with light-horſe to burne the Country, which they never in the leaſt way prevailed in, but many times returned with a weaker maſter then they went forth. Yet Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> they ſpared no labour or induſtry, Sir <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Stewart</hi> march'd to <hi>New-Towne</hi> and relieved it, but the Enemy ſaved all their heads by their heels, but ſix men; afterwards march'd up to <hi>Caſtle-derge,</hi> burnt all the Enemies Country and killed divers, brought 400. Cowes, then march'd up over againſt <hi>Gla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

Sir <hi>William Stewart</hi> in the meane time was as buſie in the Barrony of <hi>Kilmackrenan</hi> firing and burning.</p>
            <p>Captaine <hi>Maxwell,</hi> and Captaine <hi>George Stewart</hi> marcht towards <hi>Ramalton</hi> with 150 men, and killed 90. of the Rebels, and brought home 1800. Cowes. Captaine <hi>Baſill</hi> about the ſame time being New-yeares day marcht over into the enemies Countrey with 60. men, and encountred 400. men, and killed 36.</p>
            <p>M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> I will not trouble you with retailing of Newes thus in ſmall parcels, but I am ſure ſo equally vigilant and difficult was the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:156741:7"/>
preſerving of their owne quarters, and ſcowring the neighbouring quarters of the enemies, that our Regiment on the other ſide of the mountaines at that preſent having no intelligence of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all defeats, having marched 7. dayes and nights upon mountaines, where never horſemen rode in a deep ſnow, 13. miles the leaſt dayes march, where and when the beſt Commander never taſted bread, beere, wine, ſalt, or Aqua-vitae, and at every night fought with the Rebels for his bed-cloathes (God be praiſed with ſtrange ſucceſſe) and being in the ſight of the enemy, and for the moſt part upon the Ice (notwithſtanding the weather ſtript in our ſhirts, upon our marching homewards met ſuch a packe of them drawne out by the other two Regiments, that they beſet us in our quarter at night, which we expecting, appointed a near Fort for our Alarum place for two Companies to draw unto, and the other two Companies into a wood, where if by Gods mercy we ſhould have the better of them; we were aſſured they ſhould paſſe, all happened accordingly; for our Sentenels giving a timely Alarum, the two Companies tooke the Fort, beat them off untill they fled the right way, where the two Companies unexpectedly met them with ſharp fire, and the other two ſallyed out of the Fort upon their Reares, and did very terrible execution: Immediately after which we marched away in the night, and ſurpriſed many in the neighbouring houſes, and laſtly, burnt the quarters, and all the corne in the whole march, which was out of command. And truly Sir <hi>Ralph Gore</hi> his zeale was very ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, for the moſt tempeſtuous nights he would alwayes chuſe to fall upon their quarters, which at laſt were upon every hand of our garriſon; for he having placed for the ſafety of thoſe parts one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at <hi>Kilbegge,</hi> another at Caſtle <hi>Rabin,</hi> and one being left to maintaine our owne quarters, we had but two Companies for the Field; yet at divers times we would march out to them, being at the leaſt 13. Colours, and overnight having taken the ditches with Mus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keteers, drew them in with counterfeit retreats, untill we had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged at 40. yards diſtance, ſometimes a 100. Musketeers, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times more, every Musket charged with 10. Piſtoll Bullets.</p>
            <p>But M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> our good ſucceſſe ended with our Ammunition, for all being ſpent to one Roll of Match, and ſending a Letter for ſome ſupply, the traytor run to the Rebels, delivered my Letter, and what I had but modeſtly put into the Text concerning our wants, he being a ſouldier in the Regiment made a large Comment upon, which heartened the Rebels ſo much that we were like to periſh for want of food, and certainly had, if Sir <hi>Robert Stewart</hi> with his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and three of Sir <hi>Will.

<pb n="11" facs="tcp:156741:7"/>
by ſome looſe Files of the enemies ſhot, which he beat off, and ſo without much danger ſecured the march of the entire Body.</p>
            <p>But now M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> the Countrey being waſted by the enemy, and our ſelves, the dayes beginning <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o grow longer, we thought beſt to joyne all three Regiments, leaving <hi>Balliſhannon,</hi> Caſtle of <hi>Done<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall,</hi> and Caſtle <hi>Rahin</hi> well manned, and as well as we could provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded otherwiſe, and ſo betooke our ſelves with what ſtrength we could ſpare unto the Fields. And now M. <hi>Speaker,</hi> if I can borrow your patience, I preſume I ſhall acquaint you with very good ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In our march over the mountaines of <hi>Barneſmore</hi> homewards to the Barrony of <hi>Rapho,</hi> this <hi>Barneſmore</hi> being knowne to every Inhabitant in <hi>Ireland</hi> to be as dangerous a place as Art and Nature could deviſe. When the Van-guard of our Army entred the wood, we ſent 60. looſe ſhot upon each of our flankes, halfe Calliver ſhot from our Body through the woods, where they skirmiſht with the enemy, having taken the wood overnight, in very hot ſervice upon both ſides. The Rebels had placed 13. Colours in a hollow, halfe a mile above us, who when they heard our ſhot ſhewed themſelves, thinking as they confeſt to draw us out whileſt 13. Colours more lay hidden in another hollow, that ſhould ſuddenly fall in upon the remaining party, and had likewiſe placed 9. Colours below to fall in upon the baggage, which was at leaſt 3000. ſoules, who travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led below almoſt a mile off, in a narrow paſſe. We drew out (ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the worſt) onely ſome commanded Musketeers skirmiſht and beat away their firſt body that appeared, when immediately the other 9. Colours fell in upon the baggage, to which we aſſigned 48. Musketeers, who held them up couragiouſly in a ſtrait paſſe. We that were with the maine body perceiving it, having a wood and bogge under us, drew with more haſte then order (as requiſite it was) to their reliefe, ſo that we likewiſe put them to flight. In the meane time the 13. Colours in ambuſh all this while fell into our Reare, and all their forces in the twinkling of an eye fell round upon us, which we with countercommanded Musketeers oppoſed, and during the ſpace of 7. houres and a halfe (by a watch) fought and kild 400. of their men, beſides what fell in our march of ſixe miles, where having conveighed our baggage between two diviſions, were ſtill charged in our Reare, and the extremities of our flankes that had thicke ſhot returned by 200. Musketeers of ours, ſo that as by a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner of theirs taken the next day that was preſent at the battell, 700. was confeſt to be ſlaine, in which we loſt but nine men, and ſome hurt. That night we marcht into our quarters in the <hi>Barrony</hi> of <hi>Rapho.</hi> This occurrence happened about eight weeks ſince.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Philim O Nele</hi> drew downe to <hi>Strebane</hi> about 5000. men be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides horſe, intending to burne <hi>Rapho,</hi> and to raiſe <hi>Eniſhoen,</hi> and we being as he abſolutely conceived deſeated, to draw the other forces on the contrary ſide of <hi>Loghfoyle,</hi> and to aſſault the <hi>Derry.</hi> Our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments aſſiſted with two ſtrong Companies of Captaine <hi>Pitts</hi> and Captaine <hi>Lawſons</hi> of the City of <hi>London-derry</hi> drew over before day into the Rebels Countrey, where preſently the battels were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered upon both ſides, and ſo ſtood about a quarter of a miles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we drew out to them one Battalion, and a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>00. commanded Musketeers to try how they would anſwer them. The Rebels left their ground, and drew out to a wood, which they fil'd with their Musketeers, we likewiſe by the carneſt intreaty of our ſouldiers, were contented to loſe the advantage of our preſent embattelling, and marcht over to them, beat their Musketeers out of the wood, and to omit circumſtances killed about 500. of their men, and put them to their flight, in which day was great circumſpection and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline uſed by the Commanders, and as much obedience and reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the ſouldiers, M <hi>Cathcart Cornett</hi> to Sir <hi>Robert Stewarts</hi> troop, and Lieutenant <hi>Colaſe</hi> one of his Lieutenants, and Lieutenant <hi>Galbraith</hi> one of our Regiment about 17. years of age, doing very ſtrange ſervice with their commanded Musketeers.</p>
            <p>In purſuance (by Gods mercy) of this victory, though we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned weary unto our quarters, yet by breake of day the Regiments were upon march, an unuſuall way to <hi>Strebane,</hi> thinking to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet him and his forces which quartered there viſibly. To this purpoſe horſe and foot entred the Towne upon all quarters; but Sir <hi>Phelomy</hi> was newly departed with his forces, onely the Caſtle he committed to Captaine <hi>Hugh Murragh O Devyn</hi> a bloudy fellow, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his choiſe Musketeers, and a 100 Pikes to guard much of his owne baggage, and my Lady <hi>Strebanes</hi> goods; but we eaſily forced the Caſtle, put the men to the ſword, onely Captaine <hi>O Devins</hi> life reſpited, who is now in the <hi>Derry</hi> Gaole. The Caſtle we left-a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon in, commanded by Captaine <hi>Wiſher</hi> a diſcreet Gentleman under the command of <hi>St. Wil. Hammilton,</hi> who though formerly a ſtrong rooted Papiſt (if any root can be in that titular Religion) hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the ſame, and conforming himſelfe unto the Proteſtant Church, judging upon this reaſon (as I have heard from himſelfe) that neither faith, civill converſation, ſecure commerce, found loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, much more Religion ought to be expected where ſuch bloudy,

traiterous &amp; inhumane deſignes are, or muſt be the propagators of it.</p>
            <p>From <hi>Strebane</hi> we having left 500. men to guard the Barrony of <hi>Rapho,</hi> we marched up on the <hi>ô Canes</hi> country on the other ſide of <hi>Loghfoyle,</hi> and comming over againſt <hi>Derry,</hi> quartered in the fields that night, foure Companies of the <hi>Derry</hi> joyning with us to relieve <hi>Lymmavaddy</hi> Caſtle and <hi>Bally</hi> Caſtle, which had beene ten weekes before ſtrongly beleager'd by great forces, and yet had ſallied forth and killed many hundred of the enemies, being commanded by a reſolute young Gentleman Captaine <hi>Thomas Philips,</hi> his Elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther M. <hi>Dudly Philips</hi> in the meane time being gone about with 3. Botes for to carry their proviſion from <hi>Derry.</hi> That night we were welcome gueſts to the two Caſtles, who diſpaired of all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour, and having conducted their proviſion in, the next Morning aſſiſted with very reſolute Horſe out of the two Caſtles, we advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced our march into the Enemies country, where at <hi>Magiligan</hi> wee encountred the Enemy, the <hi>ô Canes,</hi> the <hi>Magilligans,</hi> the <hi>ô Hagans</hi> and the <hi>ô Neales</hi> being joyned together for our utter ruine, (God be praiſed) we killed upwards of 500 of them, and ſcattered the reſt.</p>
            <p>Though we were now too farre in diſcretion engaged from our own Quarters, yet having received late Letters from <hi>Colrane</hi> of their miſerable wants and narrow beleagure, we continued our march up towards the Mountaines to find ſome prey, that we might be the welcomer to almoſt famiſh'd <hi>Colrane;</hi> we met with 3000. Cowes, but with thrice as many men; the Rebell having ſtrengthened him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe from the Army that beleagured <hi>Colrane</hi> and other parts: Our Commanders cheriſhed the Souldier, and the Souldier the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; but the Rebels having that Morning (moved by the vali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant preaching of a Fryer) bound themſelves by Oath of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament received thereupon, to fight this Battell to the laſt man, and to hunt us out of their Country, gave us a warme charge and forced our Horſe and commanded Musketters to retreat upon the wings of our Battalions, yet after our ſhort, yet earneſt Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, we advanced towards them, and ſlaughtered above 800. of them, which being an unuſuall ſight to them, they forgat the Fryers Doctrine and their owne application and fled, our Horſe and Foot chaſing them a hundred wayes with great ſlaughter: From thence with our prey and abundance of Horſe, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we march'd to <hi>Dungevin</hi> Caſtle, one of the Kings Houſes, which was kept by Collonell <hi>Manus mac quy ballagh, Mac Richard ô Cane,</hi> who (though in this battell) had fled thither to his charge, upon parley he delivered up the Caſtle, and deſired the Kings mercy, which upon conditions was afforded; the Armes and Pillage were quickly divided. From thence we marched to <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rane,</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:156741:9"/>
every Regiment beſtowed ſome upon the Towne, the ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers at eaſie rates ſold the reſt, but ſuch as were delivered to the right owners.</p>
            <p>At Caſtle <hi>Roe</hi> a myle from <hi>Colrane</hi> were lodged ſeven Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours of the Enemies to ſecure the band fiſhing to themſelves; we tooke the Colours, put many to the Sword, and the Town of <hi>Colrane</hi> hath a Garriſon there now, and enjoyes the fiſhing to themſelves, being the greateſt <hi>Salmon-fiſhing</hi> in Chriſtendome.</p>
            <p>From thence we made our ſpeedy march home, where our Horſe kil'd about a hundred ſtraglers, and found our owne Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters invaded with above 2000. men, which our remaining par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had with good reſolution and ſucceſſe kept off, upon adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement of our returne, they deputed no longer ſtay.</p>
            <p>In all theſe particulars (all honour to God Almighty who fought our battels) amongſt the three Regiments wee loſt not a hundred men ſince the firſt Rebellion to the laſt hoare.</p>
            <p>We have at the preſent theſe Garriſons, Caſtle of <hi>Strebane, Lifford, Rapho, Dromboe</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Litterkenny, Ramalton, Lyma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaddy, Bally</hi> Caſtle, <hi>Ballyſhannon, Donagall,</hi> Caſtle <hi>Rahin,</hi> being pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of great conſequence by ſcituation and ſtrength.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> this is a briefe Relation of ſo many paſſages in ſuch a tract of time; an Epitome of that which was a large volume in our owne ſufferings and the conſtruction of our Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, which in duty I ſuppoſe I was bound to preſent unto this Honourable Aſſembly, in the Port and Haven of whoſe unpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd labours we anchor our ſafety. You may be pleaſed (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Speaker)</hi> to remember our ſudden ſurpriſall, our wants of all manner of ſupplies for preſervation of our lives, much more for the defence of a Country, and ſuch places of importance; you may conſider the Reſolution of men encouraged by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of their Armes fleſh'd in the bloud of their enemies, imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened by knowledge of the Country, provoked by the loſſe of their deareſt pledges, wives, children and all; the hazard in tranſporting men ſaved, the charges in raiſing, levying, ſhipping, demurrage upon winde, and the like prevented; the great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of the Commanders amounting to above 3000<hi rend="sup">•b</hi>. for armes, victuals, cloaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> their offenſive ſervice without loſſe of a 100 men, their defenſive vigilancy of ſo much ground, the ſeverall Garriſons of conſequence maintained, the weake inſtruments by which the ſervice was effected, and the great Mercy of God by which we were protected; then we doubt not, but the Juſtice of this Houſe will continue us in our Reſolutions, encourage o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to attempt better; all which we ſhall in our humble Petition more ſeaſonably preſent.</p>
